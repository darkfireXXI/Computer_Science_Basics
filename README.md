# Computer Science Basics

Because even after doing algorithm trading, physics, and earning an MSc in engineering you still have to prove you can sort a list.

We'll go in order of speed from slowest to fasted:

## 1 Sorting
1.1 Bubble sort  
1.2 Insertion sort  
1.3 Selection sort  
1.4 Quick sort   
1.5 Merge sort  
## 2 Searching  
2.1 Linear Search  
2.2 Jump Search  
2.3 Binary Search
